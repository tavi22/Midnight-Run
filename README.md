# Midnight Run
8x8 Led Matrix based game.

## Description
 Midnight Run is a simple, arcade-like racing game.
 The car (blinking led on the bottom of the matrix) is stuck on the same row at the bottom and you can move it left or right in order to avoid the "falling" obstacles. You have a maximum health of 4 on Easy difficulty and you lose one for every object that collides with your car. When you pass an obstacle you gather points. If your health is 0 and you crash the game will end, saving your score and checking if it is a highscore. When you get a score that is higher than one of the 5 stored in memory, you will get a congratulations message.
 By advancing in level, the objects change their shape, making it harder for you to avoid them.
 By advancing in difficulty, the falling speed increases, rewarding you with a higher score per object passed.
 Level 5 is the last level so far and if you pass it, the game ends in a win situation.
